DECRYPTION

So this guy, Evan, wrote all of his code in a terribly stagnated and outdated format, very sloppily might I add.
- This is an attempt at righting the wrong.

i_* == "include" : Files are included
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- i_eBankingLogin
- i_footer
- i_header
- i_navbar
- i_uppernav

"Pages", not marked as such, include :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- locations
- mission
- atm
- contact
- cd
- employment
- privacy
- rates
- remote deposit
- history

event_* == these are event pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- event_fishing

Illusions: These are so annoying... Perfect example of sloppy programming
-- The correct solution would be to actually set the files into a directory named the prefix and cut off the filename before the underscore.
- business_*
- personal_*

Leaving TBOC
- outside

404 - obvious
