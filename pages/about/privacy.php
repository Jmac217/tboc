  <br>
    Our Internet financial services providers may collect general information  on our  website and Portal visitors simply to help us provide banking  and other  financial services to you online. They collect certain  information on  our behalf for security and statistical purposes. The  information  collected for these purposes may include:<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li type="circle">The Internet address (referral site) which brought you to our web site </li>
    <li type="circle">The date and time you access our site; </li>
    <li type="circle">The name and version of your web browser; </li>

    <li type="circle">Your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and </li>

  </ul>
  <p>eBanking  may use cookies to collect this general  information on all website and  Portal Visitors. They also use cookies  for security purposes in our  Internet Banking service and for  customization and personalization of  the Portal.<br>
    <br>
    In the future, we may use aggregate,  general,  non-personally identifiable information to help us market our  products  and services that may be of interest you.<br>
  <br>
    Additional information about IP addresses and cookies are provided below.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</strong><br>
    An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to  your  computer whenever you're on the Internet. Web servers, the  computers  that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your  computer by its  IP address.<br>
  <br>
    When collecting information for us, eBanking does not  link IP  addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that  a  user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous.<br>
  <br>
    eBanking may use IP addresses to audit the use of our  site. They can  and will use IP addresses to identify a user when  necessary for  security purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What is a Cookie?</strong><br>
    A cookie is a very small text file sent by a web server and  stored on  your hard drive, your computer's memory, or in your browser  so that it  can be read back later. Cookies cannot "read" information  about you  from your computer or be used to "steal" information about  you; and  cookies don't carry viruses. Cookies are a basic way for a  server to  identify you (most cookies actually identify the computer you  happen to  be using at the time, not you personally). Cookies are used  for many  things from personalizing start up pages to facilitating  online  purchases. Cookies help sites recognize return visitors and they   perform a very important function when you engage in secure Internet   banking. For your security, we do not store any of your personal   information in our cookies. The cookies used in our Internet banking   system and Portal are further described below.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Internet Banking Cookies</strong> <br>
    eBanking uses encrypted cookies that do not pass to your  computer's  hard drive. Instead, the cookie is stored in your computer's  memory,  identifying only your computer while you are logged on. Only   eBanking can read the information in these cookies. This Internet   banking cookie allows eBanking to process multiple transactions   during your session without requiring you to reenter your pass code for   each individual transaction. The cookies for Internet banking simply   provide another level of security for our Internet banking product.   When you log off, or close your browser, the cookie is destroyed. A new   cookie is used for each session. That way, no one can use the prior   cookie to access your account. For additional security, the cookie   expires after 10 minutes of inactivity. It must then be renewed by   reentering your pass code. eBanking does not (and cannot) use this   cookie to collect or obtain new personal information about you. You   must allow your browser to accept this cookie so you can use the   Internet banking system.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Portal Cookies</strong>:<br>
    eBanking uses several cookies to provide features within  the Portal.  They send a "Web Trends" cookie to all Portal visitors in  order to help  us collect general information on all Portal visitors.  This cookie is  sent to your computer hard drive and provides us  information such as;  when you accessed our site, which pages you  accessed in the portal, and  what Internet provider you used when you  accessed our site. The  information collected through this cookie is not  personally  identifiable and is only used for statistical purposes to  assist us in  our planning process and our marketing program.<br>
  <br>
    When visitors register on the Portal and select the  "Remember Me"  checkbox, eBanking sends additional cookies to your  hard drive,  which enable you to customize the Portal and bypass the  login process  each time you revisit the Portal. These cookies are  retained on your  computer until you either delete them or click on the  Logout link  within the Portal. These cookies only contain a unique user   identification number and do not contain or collect any personally   identifiable information.<br>
  <br>
    When registered users login to the Portal, eBanking sends  an  additional cookie called a "per--session" cookie or "server-side"   cookie. This "server-side" cookie resides in the browser and is only   used by eBanking to monitor the session by a unique identification   number. This cookie is used for security purposes and you must allow   your browser to accept the "server-side" cookie to use the Portal. The   cookie is destroyed after eight hours.<br>
  <br>
    When you click on advertisements on the Portal or at 3rd  party  merchants within they Portal, they may also send you a cookie to   collect general non-personally identifiable information. You do not   have to accept these cookies to use the Portal.<br>
