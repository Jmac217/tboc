Go ahead and clean out the res folder again after this

If lib/ is here to stay, set jQuery inside it as well; that's just annoying.

#pages probably shouldn't overflow

revisit the load_link function and prepare all pages to load correctly, whether it be in the #pages div or in another tab. The new window thing doesn't exactly matter
- this means the load() function will need to be finished, probably first.
- for now all pages except for external links will load into the front page

Testing email sendings will require the existing mail() functions to be commented and replaced by one with either mine or Tom's email address, mine for now.

The css structure of the Security Center is not coordinated well with the rest of the index, which is not important for the demonstration but will need to be reassessed.
Also pages' css names are stupid and calculated widths don't work in IE, plus table borders still need work.

The navigation links are now populated by nav.json, but neither indexOf() nor $.inArray() correctly search the objects of nav[], so it's only possible for now to refrain multiple's appearing consecutively.

notices still needs converted into JSON with a URL to a markdown folder, this markdown folder could probably be hosted on the client-side if we decide to create the control panel offline.

something will have to be done about load_link being called twice from the nav links, since get_nav() loads plain-text and .on() is attached to $(document)
